// CHALLENGE #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

// Your task is to write some code to help them:

// Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.

// Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.

// Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.

// BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too

// TEST DATA: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

// const massMark = 78;
// const heightMark = 1.69;
// const massJohn = 92;
// const heightJohn = 1.95;

const massMark = 95;
const heightMark = 1.88;
const massJohn = 85;
const heightJohn = 1.76;

const bmiMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
const bmiJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

console.log(bmiMark);
console.log(bmiJohn);
console.log(bmiMark, bmiJohn);

markHigherBMI = bmiMark > bmiJohn;
console.log(markHigherBMI);
